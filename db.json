They have a full bar and a decent cocktail menu as well as your standard beer choices. I haven't tried their food yet but it smelled really good.  I look forward to going back and trying some.",

I had a manhattan and it was one of the better ones I've had in awhile. People would sing along to the songs, but the music wasn't too loud. you could still carry a descent conversation. I'm looking forward to trying some of their food and watching football here with friends in the fall.",

What I have liked the most is that it was not busy when I was there, but both bartenders worked the entire time. Jeremy was friendly, drinks were perfectly balanced, and he never missed a beat when my glass was getting emptier. I really appreciated his attention to detail when he opened a new bag of peanuts. He made sure that the ones that were on the bottom ended up on top. It seems funny to point that out, but it is telling on how the bar is handled in general.  Welcome Double J Saloon to LCW!",

I've been delaying writing this review because I love the fact stumbling upon Double J Saloon and feeling like I've discovered a super cool secret. The music slash playlist is always on point. The bartenders are also super friendly. They always try to make a point in learning my name and trying to remember it. They also provide some pretty sweet board games. You can easily play chess, while simultaneously playing Jenga and scrabble- whoa.  Don't judge a book by its cover because the interior is super clean, bathrooms are really nice, and the drinks - my personal fav the cucumber cooler never disappoints!",
