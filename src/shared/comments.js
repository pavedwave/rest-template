    comment: "The Double J really fills a need in this neighborhood, it's a full service bar that you wouldn't be embarrassed to take out-of-town folks too. They have a full bar and a decent cocktail menu as well as your standard beer choices. I haven't tried their food yet but it smelled really good.  I look forward to going back and trying some.",

    comment: "A perfect neighborhood bar filled with board games, classic 80's and 90's music, and a pool table. I couldn't ask for more! Drinks were reasonably priced. I had a manhattan and it was one of the better ones I've had in awhile. People would sing along to the songs, but the music wasn't too loud. you could still carry a descent conversation. I'm looking forward to trying some of their food and watching football here with friends in the fall.",

    comment: "Scratch cocktail for $7. Not too boozy (The Back Door is good for that) and delicious. Food bites (did not have any, but it looked great). Free peanuts. Salty and good. What I have liked the most is that it was not busy when I was there, but both bartenders worked the entire time. Jeremy was friendly, drinks were perfectly balanced, and he never missed a beat when my glass was getting emptier. I really appreciated his attention to detail when he opened a new bag of peanuts. He made sure that the ones that were on the bottom ended up on top. It seems funny to point that out, but it is telling on how the bar is handled in general.  Welcome Double J Saloon to LCW!",

    comment: "Quaint dive bar ambiance where the food outshines the drink which is a tough feat in itself.  Hats off to THE CHEF- your BBQ beef and pulled pork sando tickled my test buds.  This is a great bar to come to after work with some co-workers and knock a few.  Surprisingly delighted.",

    comment: "This place is a great dive bar. They have the best ribs in town. I have had them without bbq sauce because they are so so moist. They have great bbq sauce 3 different KC style and a Carolina if you so choose",

    comment: "This place is my jam, refuge, local hang, and all that really good stuff in between. I've been delaying writing this review because I love the fact stumbling upon Double J Saloon and feeling like I've discovered a super cool secret. The music slash playlist is always on point. The bartenders are also super friendly. They always try to make a point in learning my name and trying to remember it. They also provide some pretty sweet board games. You can easily play chess, while simultaneously playing Jenga and scrabble- whoa.  Don't judge a book by its cover because the interior is super clean, bathrooms are really nice, and the drinks - my personal fav the cucumber cooler never disappoints!",

    comment: "Good, neighborhood place in the thick of Lake City Way. Delicious beverages! Ask about their shot-and-beer combinations. Friendly staff. Tacos, chili, other pub food. Nice, down home, real people. Pool table. Cool decorations, too.",
